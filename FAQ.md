## 🛠️ Usage

### Which Affinity versions are supported?
*Affinity v1 and v2 both work in most cases using this tutorial.*
> [!TIP]
> Official Affinity installers download links:
>
> | Program | URL |
> |---------|-----|
> |V2 (all)     |https://store.serif.com/en-us/account/licences/         |
> |Photo V1     | https://store.serif.com/it/update/windows/photo/1/     |
> |Designer V1  | https://store.serif.com/it/update/windows/designer/1/  |
> |Publisher V1 | https://store.serif.com/it/update/windows/publisher/1/ |

> [!WARNING]
> Be advised that, if you purchased the old **1.X version** of the Affinity applications through the [**Windows Store**](https://apps.microsoft.com/), you will **not** be able to activate your old licence on another operating systems other than Windows.  
> The Windows Store does not provide the product key you will need to enter after the installation, so, if you want to stay on Linux and don't want to buy a V2 licence (since V1 isn't sold anymore), your only option is to use a Windows virtual machine, sign into your Microsoft account on the Windows Store, and download your V1 apps from there.
