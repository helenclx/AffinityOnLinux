# Set Up Wine for Affinity Apps Using Rum

## Preface

This guide aims to provide a way to manage wine that does not make use of launchers like Lutris or Bottles.
We will instead use `rum`, a small shell script that will help us manage multiple wine runners.

## Dependencies
Install the following programs (or the equivalent for your distro) before proceeding. 
- wget
- unzip
- git
- [winetricks](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks)

### Debian-based distros:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wget unzip git winetricks
```

### Arch-based distros:
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy wget unzip git winetricks
```

### Fedora-based distros:
```bash
sudo dnf install wget unzip git winetricks
```

## Directories Setup

First, we'll create two directories in `~/.local/share/` which will help us organize our runners and prefixes without messing up our `$HOME`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/wine/runners
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/wine/prefixes
```

## Wine Runner Download

Then we'll download a build of ElementalWarrior's wine fork and `unzip` it.

> [!NOTE]
> You can check [ElementalWarrior-x86_64](https://github.com/seapear/AffinityOnLinux/releases/download/Legacy/ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64.tar.gz) page for newer builds of ElementalWarrior's wine fork.

```bash
pushd ~/.local/share/wine/runners &&
wget https://github.com/seapear/AffinityOnLinux/releases/download/Legacy/ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64.tar.gz &&
tar xvzf ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64.tar.gz &&
rm ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64.tar.gz &&
popd
```

## `rum` Setup

Download `rum` into `/opt`

```
cd /opt/
sudo git clone https://gitlab.com/xkero/rum.git
```

Let the current user you're logged in as take ownership of the folder.

```
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER rum/
```

Create a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/`

```
sudo ln -sf /opt/rum/rum /usr/local/bin/rum
```

We also need to make a small change in `rum` to adapt it the custom runners path we previously set up:

```bash
nano /opt/rum/rum
```

Change the `wines` variable to:

```
wines="$HOME/.local/share/wine/runners"
```

Now let's test if it's setup correctly.
Just run `rum` without arguments and check if it prints the following:

```plain
Not enough arguments!
Usage: rum <wine-version or /path/to/wine/version> </path/to/wine/prefix> <wine command> [wine arguments...]

Wine versions available:
ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64
```

Notice how `rum` correctly found our `ElementalWarriorWine`.

## Alias Setup
We'll register an alias so that we don't need to always give `rum` the full path to the affinity wine prefix.
Open either your `.bashrc` or dedicated `.bash_aliases` file, and add the following alias:

```bash
alias wine-ew-affinity='rum ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64 $HOME/.local/share/wine/prefixes/affinity/'
```

I gave mine a pretty verbose name, but feel free to name it how you like.
Also remember to `source` the file you just modified for the changes to take effect, e.g:
```bash
source ~/.bash_aliases
```
Verify once again that your alias is setup correctly by calling it without arguments and checking that you see the same error as before.

> *If you're using Fish as your default shell, you might have to manage your aliases and environment variables in Fish's configuration files instead of .bashrc. For the alias you added, you can define it in Fish by editing `nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish` (create it if it doesn't exist) and adding:*

> `alias wine-ew-affinity='rum ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64 $HOME/.local/share/wine/prefixes/affinity/`

## Wine Prefix Configuration

### Initialization
We're now ready to actually set up the wine environment to run our Affinity installer in.

First, initialize the prefix:

```bash
wine-ew-affinity wineboot --init
```

### Winetricks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We use the `remove_mono` verb becase the .NET version we're installing would directly conflict with it, as stated in the [Wine Mono README](https://github.com/wine-mono/wine-mono?tab=readme-ov-file#composition:~:text=Wine%20Mono%20should%20always%20be%20removed%20before%20installing%20.NET%20Framework%204.8%20and%20earlier%2C%20it%20can%20coexist%20with%20.NET%20Core%20and%20.NET%205%20or%20later.)

Now run winetricks with the following options to install all the needed dependencies in your Affinity prefix:

```bash
wine-ew-affinity winetricks --unattended --force remove_mono vcrun2022 dotnet48  corefonts win11
```

> [!NOTE]
> We set the renderer to vulkan in a separate step, after all the previews winetricks have been applied.


```bash
wine-ew-affinity winetricks renderer=vulkan
```

> [!NOTE]
> This step will take a while and throw a bunch of warnings. This is expected so be patient and let it run.

### Getting WinMetadata

We'll now download some Windows system files and place them in the C drive of our prefix:

```bash
pushd ~/.local/share/wine/prefixes/affinity/drive_c/windows/system32/ &&
wget https://archive.org/download/win-metadata/WinMetadata.zip &&
unzip WinMetadata.zip &&
rm WinMetadata.zip &&
popd
```

## Installing Affinity Software
We're finally ready to actually run the installer.

> [!TIP]
> Official installers download links:
>
> | Program | URL |
> |---------|-----|
> |V2 (all)     |https://store.serif.com/en-us/account/licences/         |
> |Photo V1     | https://store.serif.com/it/update/windows/photo/1/     |
> |Designer V1  | https://store.serif.com/it/update/windows/designer/1/  |
> |Publisher V1 | https://store.serif.com/it/update/windows/publisher/1/ |


I'll use the installer for Affinity Photo V1 as an example.

```bash
wine-ew-affinity wine ~/Downloads/affinity-photo-1.10.6.exe
```

![installer](./Screenshots/installer.png)

Click `Install`, and ignore all the warnings wine throws.  
Once it completes, close the installer.

Finally, launch the software!

```bash
wine-ew-affinity wine ~/.local/share/wine/prefixes/test/drive_c/Program\ Files/Affinity/Photo/Photo.exe
```

## Additional Tips & Tricks

### Fixing Scaling on HiDPI Screens

To adjust the scaling on high resolution monitors, run:

```bash
wine-ew-affinity winecfg
```
- Go on the `Graphics` tab
- Temporarily enable `Emulate a virtual desktop`
- Adjust the `Desktop size`
- Disable `Emulate a virtual desktop`
- Increase the `dpi` to your preference

> [!NOTE]
> As I understand it, the `dpi` value is a percentage applied to the currently set `Desktop Size`.  
> So, for a 4k monitor, setting the desktop size to `1920 x 1080` and scaling it by 200% works quite well.

## Creating a .desktop launcher
Create a .desktop launcher by following this [Desktop Launcher Guide](https://github.com/seapear/AffinityOnLinux/blob/main/Guides/Rum/Guide-DesktopLauncher.md) so you can open affinity from your desktop.
